 "How long could we maintain? I wondered. How long until one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy? What will 
 he think then? This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family; will he make that grim connection 
 when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car? If so, well, we'll just 
 have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere, 'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report
 us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency and they'll run us down like dogs. Jesus, did I say that?
 Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?" <br><br>
 "There was madness in any direction, at any hour. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal 
 sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle - that sense of 
 inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy 
 would simply prevail. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, 
 less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of 
 eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back." <br><br>
